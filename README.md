There are 3 Dice:

Dice 1 - Five sides are 3 and one side is 6  
Dice 2 - Five sides are 4 and one side is 1  
Dice 3 - Three sides are 5 and three sides are 2  

The game is simple. Player 1 picks a die and then Player 2 selects one of the remaining two. Whoever rolls the highest wins. 

Puzzle to figure out:

Which player would you want to be and which die you would want to select for each player? 
How does this change if the game is the sum of two rolls rather than a single roll? How does it generalise to N rolls?
