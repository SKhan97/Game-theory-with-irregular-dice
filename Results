'Transparent' = 5/6 probability of 3 --- 1/6 probability of 6
'Grey' = 1/2 probability of 2  --- 1/2 probability of 5
'Blue' = 1/6 probability of 1 --- 5/6 probability of 4


Overview of 10,000 rolls vs each other die

Transparent beats Grey with an average of 58.27 win rate
Transparent loses to Blue with an average of only 30.62 win rate

Grey beats Blue with an average of 59.04 win rate
Grey loses to Transparent with an average of only 41.47 win rate

Blue beats Transparent with an average of 69.41 win rate
Blue loses to Grey with an average of only 41.7 win rate

(Slightly naive approach but seems logical and gives good heuristic)
Simulating 10,000 rolls vs every other die, it seems as if the heirachy is as follows:

Transparent > Grey > Blue > Transparent

Looking at the win rates, it's evident that each die has one it beats and one it loses. Therefore it always makes sense to go 
for Player 2 in this game and simply pick the die which is superior to the one your opponent picks. If you have to go Player 1 
then picking Blue makes sense since it has the largest win rate by far but also a 'good loss rate' alongside Grey.

Tbh if you know the odds are stacked against you (assuming perfect play by opponent) then maybe Player 1 should go for the 
Transparent die and try to hit the 1/6 chance of getting a 6 and winning no matter what. It's hopeful but shoot for the moon sometimes.
